type class defines operators by type-
OOP is object oriented, and defines operators relative to the object

OOP is data + ftn
type class defines only ftns wrt given type
	(data is managed in pure data type)
// static methods in OOP is somewhat in between OOP and type class

for instance addition of a type A

oop:
	A a, b
	a.add(b)
typeclass: 
	A a, b
	add(a, b)
